## Walmart Salas Analysis

This project originates from the increasing necessity for managers to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing sales, thereby enhancing their marketing campaigns and inventory management strategies. Effective management of these elements is crucial for optimizing sales performance and ensuring efficient resource allocation.

Our dataset encompasses data from 45 distinct Walmart stores, offering a comprehensive view of various influencing factors. Specifically, this dataset includes weekly sales figures alongside key economic indicators such as Temperature, Consumer Price Index (CPI), Fuel Prices, and Unemployment Rates, all recorded at regular intervals throughout the year. By examining this diverse array of data, we aim to uncover potential correlations and patterns that may exist between these variables over different time periods.

The primary goal of this analysis is to identify how these economic and environmental factors interact with sales performance. Understanding these relationships can provide valuable insights for managers, enabling them to predict sales trends more accurately and make informed decisions about marketing and inventory management. For instance, identifying a correlation between temperature and sales could help in planning seasonal promotions, while understanding the impact of fuel prices on consumer spending can guide pricing strategies.

Through this project, we seek to apply statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to explore these relationships in depth. By doing so, we hope to develop predictive models that can assist managers in anticipating changes in sales and adjusting their strategies accordingly. Ultimately, this project aims to equip managers with the knowledge and tools needed to optimize their operations and drive sales growth in a competitive retail environment.
