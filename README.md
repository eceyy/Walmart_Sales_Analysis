## Walmart Salas Analysis

This project originates from the increasing necessity for managers to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing sales, thereby enhancing their marketing campaigns and inventory management strategies. Effective management of these elements is crucial for optimizing sales performance and ensuring efficient resource allocation.

Our dataset encompasses data from 45 distinct Walmart stores, offering a comprehensive view of various influencing factors. Specifically, this dataset includes weekly sales figures alongside key economic indicators such as Temperature, Consumer Price Index (CPI), Fuel Prices, and Unemployment Rates, all recorded at regular intervals throughout the year. By examining this diverse array of data, we aim to uncover potential correlations and patterns that may exist between these variables over different time periods.

The primary goal of this analysis is to identify how these economic and environmental factors interact with sales performance. Understanding these relationships can provide valuable insights for managers, enabling them to predict sales trends more accurately and make informed decisions about marketing and inventory management. For instance, identifying a correlation between temperature and sales could help in planning seasonal promotions, while understanding the impact of fuel prices on consumer spending can guide pricing strategies.

Through this project, we seek to apply statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to explore these relationships in depth. By doing so, we hope to develop predictive models that can assist managers in anticipating changes in sales and adjusting their strategies accordingly. Ultimately, this project aims to equip managers with the knowledge and tools needed to optimize their operations and drive sales growth in a competitive retail environment.

The analysis steps in this project are outlined as follows:

## 1. Load and Check Data
The first step involves loading the dataset into our analysis environment. 

## 2. Data Understanding and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this step, it was aimed to delve deeper into understanding the structure and content of the dataset. 

## 3. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of our models. This step includes techniques such as transforming variables, creating interaction terms, encoding categorical variables, and generating new variables based on domain knowledge. 

## 4. Data Visualization
Data visualization is a key step in understanding the relationships between variables in our dataset. Through various plotting techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and so on, we can visually explore correlations, trends, and patterns in the data. 

## 5. Feature Selection
Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting the most relevant features for our analysis. In this step involves evaluating the importance of different features and selecting a subset that contributes the most to the predictive models.

By following these structured analysis steps, it was aimed to systematically and thoroughly explore dataset, extract meaningful insights, and build robust predictive models that can aid managers in optimizing their sales, marketing campaigns, and inventory management strategies.
